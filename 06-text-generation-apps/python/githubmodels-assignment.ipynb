    "# Build text generation apps\n",
    "\n",
    "You've seen so far through this curriculum that there are core concepts like prompts and even a whole discipline called \"prompt engineering\". Many tools you can interact with like ChatGPT, Office 365, Microsoft Power Platform and more, support you using prompts to accomplish something.\n",
    "\n",
    "For you to add such an experience to an app, you need to understand concepts like prompts, completions and choose a library to work with. That's exactly what you'll learn in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn about the openai library and its core concepts.\n",
    "- Build a text generation app using openai.\n",
    "- Understand how to use concepts like prompt, temperature, and tokens to build a text generation app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain what a text generation app is.\n",
    "- Build a text generation app using openai.\n",
    "- Configure your app to use more or less tokens and also change the temperature, for a varied output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a text generation app?\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally when you build an app it has some kind of interface like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Command-based. Console apps are typical apps where you type a command and it carries out a task. For example, `git` is a command-based app.\n",
    "- User interface (UI). Some apps have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) where you click buttons, input text, select options and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Console and UI apps are limited\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare it to a command-based app where you type a command: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **It's limited**. You can't just type any command, only the ones that the app supports.\n",
    "- **Language specific**. Some apps support many languages, but by default the app is built for a specific language, even if you can add more language support. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of text generation apps\n",
    "\n",
    "So how is a text generation app different?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a text generation app, you have more flexibility, you're not limited to a set of commands or a specific input language. Instead, you can use natural language to interact with the app. Another benefit is that because you're already interacting with a data source that has been trained on a vast corpus of information, whereas a traditional app might be limited on what's in a database. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What can I build with a text generation app?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many things you can build. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A chatbot**. A chatbot answering questions about topics, like your company and its products could be a good match.\n",
    "- **Helper**. LLMs are great at things like summarizing text, getting insights from text, producing text like resumes and more.\n",
    "- **Code assistant**. Depending on the language model you use, you can build a code assistant that helps you write code. For example, you can use a product like GitHub Copilot as well as ChatGPT to help you write code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I get started?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, you need to find a way to integrate with an LLM which usually entails the following two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use an API. Here you're constructing web requests with your prompt and get generated text back.\n",
    "- Use a library. Libraries help encapsulate the API calls and make them easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries/SDKs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few well known libraries for working with LLMs like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **openai**, this library makes it easy to connect to your model and send in prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there are libraries that operate on a higher level like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Langchain**. Langchain is well known and supports Python.\n",
    "- **Semantic Kernel**. Semantic Kernel is a library by Microsoft supporting the languages C#, Python, and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First app using GitHub Models Playground and Azure AI Inference SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can build our first app, what libraries we need, how much is required and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is GitHub Models?\n",
